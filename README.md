## NewsFeed
A lightweight test app that fetches data from RSS or XML feeds and pushes it to GitHub as raw JSON files, enabling the frontend to consume the data without the need for a traditional database.
# Purpose:
To explore the feasibility of building a functional app with no database, instead relying on structured JSON for data storage and retrieval.
Features:

Fetches live news data from RSS/XML feeds using Node.js.
Converts and stores data in JSON format on GitHub.
Frontend consumes and displays the data dynamically.
Minimalistic architecture for efficient testing.
Technologies Used: Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

### Add Testing:
Incorporate basic tests to validate the parsing and GitHub update process. Mention this as an enhancement for future scalability.
Example: Use a lightweight library like Mocha or Jest for testing.

Include Error Handling:
Highlight any mechanisms you implemented to handle errors (e.g., failed API calls or Git push issues). Recruiters value robust code.

Future Enhancements:
Mention that this tech stack could be extended to integrate caching, security (e.g., GitHub API tokens), or even a hybrid approach with a lightweight database for larger-scale use cases.


Add a Use Case:

Explain how this approach could benefit specific scenarios, such as low-budget apps or prototyping.
Showcase a Demo:

Provide a live demo link or a video walkthrough to demonstrate how the app works.
Include Scalability Considerations:

Briefly mention the limitations of this approach (e.g., difficulty scaling for large datasets) and how it could be optimized for production.
GitHub Integration:

Emphasize the creative use of GitHub for storing and serving JSON data, which is not a common approach.
Highlight Learning Goals:

Frame this as an experiment to learn about lightweight architectures and efficient data handling.

# Project Page on GitHub:
Provide a clear and concise README file that explains the stack, architecture, and goals.
Example Sections:

Overview
Tech Stack
Setup and Installation
How It Works (Include code snippets or a flow diagram)
Demo or Screenshots:
Include screenshots or a demo link showing the news feed consumption and updates.

Highlight Achievements:
State what you learned from using this tech stack and how it aligns with your problem-solving approach.
