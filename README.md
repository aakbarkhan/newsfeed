## NewsFeed
A lightweight test app that fetches data from RSS or XML feeds and pushes it to GitHub as raw JSON files, enabling the frontend to consume the data without the need for a traditional database.
# Purpose:
To explore the feasibility of building a functional app with no database, instead relying on structured JSON for data storage and retrieval.
Features:

Fetches live news data from RSS/XML feeds using Node.js.
Converts and stores data in JSON format on GitHub as raw files.
Frontend consumes and displays the data dynamically.
Minimalistic architecture for efficient testing.
Technologies Used: Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.


Add a Use Case:

Explain how this approach could benefit specific scenarios, such as low-budget apps or prototyping.
Showcase a Demo:

Provide a live demo link or a video walkthrough to demonstrate how the app works.
Include Scalability Considerations:

Briefly mention the limitations of this approach (e.g., difficulty scaling for large datasets) and how it could be optimized for production.
GitHub Integration:

Emphasize the creative use of GitHub for storing and serving JSON data, which is not a common approach.
Highlight Learning Goals:

Frame this as an experiment to learn about lightweight architectures and efficient data handling.
